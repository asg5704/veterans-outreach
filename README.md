# Veterans Outreach

## Problem
In 2012, a study from the Department of Veterans Affairs concluded that 22 veterans a day take their own life. Another fact: the suicide rate is 22 percent higher among Veterans when compared to non-Veteran adults.

Current websites that are geared towards helping Veterans have not delved deep enough into color theory or intuitive usability to get Veterans to reach out for help.

## Solution
This website’s purpose is to reduce the suicide rate of Veterans by facilitating an interactive community encouraging them to reach out for help. Although the site focuses primarily on Veterans, getting families and friends involved in our online community is also a priority.

The ‘About’, ‘Getting Help’, and ‘Talk to Someone’ will be the major points by spreading awareness, looking for warning signs, and the ability to talk with a specialist. It will be critical to research how color theory and the effects on human emotion as a primary design decision. Filling out the form in the ‘Talk to Someone’ section will need to short & concise. The chat with a suicide prevention specialist will be prominent with the button clearly stating that it will be confidential.

Our branding image will convey compassion and understanding, while facilitating Veterans to reach out.

## Analysis
The overal mood of the 'blues' and 'greens' subconsciously calm Veterans additionally by providing a Chat feature implores Veterans a quick two-step process to reach out for help.
